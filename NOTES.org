* First

  Thanks again for the offer to look over things and help me find what the issue is.  I really appreciate it.

  My only thinking at this point is that the resonators are not even close to the same frequency and thus "interfering" with each other.
  I was thinking about disassembling the dead-bug board resonator by resonator and trying to measure each one individually.
